üßë‚Äçüíº Team Contribution ‚Äì Project Background
This implementation was developed as the initial independent module of a larger team project. I was responsible for designing and coding the core logic that determines the color of a chessboard square based on its coordinates. This served as the foundation for our full-featured mobile chess application.

The project later evolved into a collaborative team effort aimed at publishing a complete chess game on Google Play. After my initial contribution:

One team member focused on building the user interface using Android Studio.

Another integrated chess piece logic and movement mechanics.

Additional teammates contributed to implementing game rules, turn handling, and performance optimizations.

Together, we successfully deployed the chess application to the Google Play Store, and this early logic module played a key role in establishing the core board behavior used throughout the app.
